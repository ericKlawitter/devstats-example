# Grafana
[Grafana]([http://github.com/grafana/grafana](http://github.com/grafana/grafana)) is the front end display for the dashboards generated by devstats. Dashboards are [automatically imported](http://docs.grafana.org/administration/provisioning/#example-datasource-config-file) when the application starts up through the configuration defined in the [provisioning](./provisioning/]) folder.

Grafana dashboards are stored in the [dashboards/knative](./dashboards/knative) directory. Any dashboards added, changed, or removed from the directory in GitHub will be detected automatically by a batch job and subsequently reflected in the Grafana UI.

By Default, devstats populates a Postgres database with GitHub metrics. This is configured in [the provisioning directory](./provisioning/datasources/datasource.yaml), and additional datasources can be configured there, as well.
